    <h1>Research Objective</h1>
    <p>
    The HMSA.com team (business, design, and development) wants to improve the usability and the end-to-end customer (consumer) experience with the HMSA.com site. 

    In late April 2018, we observed and studied how health insurance customers in Hawaii use HMSAâ€™s consumer-facing site (pre-login experience) today, compared to how they complete similar tasks in Kaiser Permanente site for Hawaii (kpinhawaii.com).
